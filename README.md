# TF_Heaviside_Function
My first attempt at building a model in Tensorflow 2.0 that mimics the Heaviside Function.

Udacity just rolled out a free online course for Tensorflow 2.0, I decided to fun I would try to build a model that could mimic the Heaviside Function that I've seen so often in my Calculus textbook. The prediction for 100 was around 0.65 (anything greater than or equal to zero should be 1, anything less than zero should be zero). I'll try this out again when I've got a little more practice! -3/7/2019
